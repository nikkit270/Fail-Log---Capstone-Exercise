# Fail-Log---Capstone-Exercise
When I began to understand and research how to code on a website, I realized what I wanted to change more and more about Pickering’s website. I began to do small things, like add a code to change the website’s background. I went to the website, double clicked and found the section “inspect” on the drop-down menu. I clicked on inspect, and on the right side of my screen popped up all the supported controls. I experimented and analyzed the coding of the website in-depth. I changed the background color to pink as an test to see what I could do, and it failed around three times before I sucessfully got the background color to change from black to pink. I went to the section that read “body”, above html, and I plugged in the code ("<body style=“background-color: pink;>”_and the background turned pink. After I realized that I could editing the content of the webpage, I added a header with a personal question that I had in my mind after I read Pickering’s final thoughts in his conclusion section. My only issue was, I added my question as a paragraph because I wasn’t succeeding adding it as a header. I used a code beginning with ‘h’ to see if it would work, and after several failed attempts, the code wouldn’t add my quesetion as a header on the website. I thought adding the question to the header would make the website more personal, as it includes a lot of statistics and limited range of colors, making it sort of boring in my opinion.
